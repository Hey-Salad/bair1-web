# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Shared agent workflow

- Treat this `AGENTS.md` as the canonical instruction file for Codex, Claude Code, and ZCode Agent.
- Use a separate Git branch or worktree per agent. Do not let two agents edit the same files concurrently.
- Never place device identifiers, precise GPS coordinates, API keys, Auth0 tokens, or Notehub secrets in commits, prompts, fixtures, or logs.
- Run the production build and lint before handing work to another agent. Report pre-existing warnings separately from new failures.
- Do not deploy or change hosted environment variables unless the user explicitly authorizes that environment change.
